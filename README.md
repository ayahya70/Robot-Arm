## Problem/Solution

### Problem

Our problem is finishing the robot arm that Ghislain and Eli worked on last year.

### Solution

We selected the articulated robot arm due to time constraints as well as level of difficulty. We will be able to use previously completed articulated robot arms to guide our project and make it much easier than if we selected a less popular type of arm. Our arm will consist of gears that will make up the arm of the robot, as well as many servos to control each individual section of the robot arm. We will code/program the arm to specifically pick up a plastic cup and move it around using the W A S D keys on the keyboard on processing.

## Criteria and Constraints

### Criteria

* Code the robot arm so that the W A S D buttons will control its movement, this will be done using processing and sublime.

* The robot arms motion should be initiated by servos controlling our harmonic drive, the gripper, and the other sections of the arm.

* The box should be powered by an easily accessible battery pack.

* We will shape this project around the goal of picking up and moving a plastic cup.

* We need to implicate gears into our project, these will likely be used to function the robot arm's gripper (open and close the teeth).


### Constraints

* We should follow the schedule and avoid taking longer than planned. Working in a timely fashion time shouldn’t be a problem.

* We should avoid printing anything that we won’t use.

* We should also make sure not to waste batteries by leaving them on overnight.

* We should make the robot arm an appropriate size so that we can fit all of our different components without making the space too crammed.

* Same goes with not making it too big so the arm will not fall over
